# 1. Introduction

## Basic Assumptions about Language

Basic assumptions:

- **Embodiedness**
  - "Language affected by and transmitted via *the body*"
- **Embeddedness**
  - "Language affects and is affected by *social situations*"
  - brain‚Äôs evolution is co-determined by social developments
- **Mental Models**

  - "Humans *represent* the world *internally*"
  - includes perceptual, spatial, emotional, causal and temporal info
- **Incremental Processing**

  - "Humans process language *over time* and *in parts*"
  - when analyzing messages, stores info is compared to the incoming signal (lexically, syntactically, semantically and world-knowledge-y) including emotion and motor aspects



## Language and Communication

**Communication:** *‚ÄúEvery action with which a person exchanges information (about needs, desires, perceptions, knowledge or affective states). Can be intentional or unintentional.‚Äù*

- No principled separation between language and other cognitive domains, since cognitive systems are modular (as can be seen in sign language).



Types of context:

- **Physical** 

  - e.g. location, time, temperature, situation of participants

- **Historical**

  - shared information (i.e. common ground)
- **Psychological**

  - perception of self and others
- **Cultural**
  - shared knowledge systems (e.g. attitude, values, behaviours)

  

**Message:** *‚ÄúConsists of complex meanings, expressed via both verbal and non-verbal symbols‚Äù*

**Symbol:** *‚ÄúCan be words, sounds and actions. Supported by facial expressions, gestures and intonation‚Äù*

**Encoding:** *‚ÄúTurning ideas and feelings into messages‚Äù*



**Medium (of the message):** *‚ÄúAny technology that created extensions of the human body and senses‚Äù*

- The ‚Äúform‚Äù of the message (e.g. how spoken words are said)
- Considered as part of the message:
  - media create their own environments. Which are beneficial to some messages and hostile to others. Which influence the interpretation of the message.
  - people might be unaware of the effects of the environment their messages reside in, because they don‚Äôt know any better



Language can be seen as a medium that extends human senses, in the sense of:

- **motor behaviour** (expressions can be seen as actions)
- **perception** (getting information from far away, e.g books)
- **emotion** (e.g. hearing a sad story makes you sad)
- **memory** (using language to record a memory)



Humans communicate via their 5 sensory channels. Using multiple channels *simultaniously* increases the chance for successful communication.



**Noise:** *‚ÄúAny stimulus that disrupts the sharing of meaning‚Äù*

- includes internal stimuli like being tired
- **Semantic noise**: "unintended meaning"



**Feedback**: *‚ÄúAny reaction to messages that indicate that the message came across/is understood‚Äù*



## Evolution of language

- Broca‚Äôs area was likely already present 2 million years ago
- We‚Äôve had fundamental speech apparatus structures for 60.000 years
- The shapes of our tongues, mouths and throats allows us to make many different sounds but also gives us too many teeth and an increased risk of choking
- **Two theories** of evolution of language:
  - Discontinuous**: language arose suddenly and spread quickly due to evolutionary advantages and passing the ability to offspring.
  - **Continuous**: gradual co-evolution of language and other human capabilities.
- **Theory** on why **communication** was beneficial for evolution:
  - Internal representation of the world proved to be a huge advantage in protecting the body.

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| The sender encodes meaning into a message and sends it through a channel.The receiver decodes the received message into meaning. <br /><br />Certain factors (such as noise) can result in differences between the encoded and decoded message.<br /><br />The Sender-Receiver model can be seen as a simplified version of two "perception-action models" interacting. This is also in line with the **LUF** | <img src="images/srmf.png" style="width:600px"> |

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Here the receiver approximates the mental state of the sender via **prediction** or **integration**.<br /><br />**Prediction:** _"(could be defined as) activating information that will come up before it's even there"_<br /><br />**Integration** happens when feedback is used to update your mental model about the situation. | <img src="images/srm.png" style="width:700px"> |



## Language User Framework

_Framework_ instead of _model_, because models are much more specific and specifies interactions, it's more like a "systematic inventory of all you need when you listen or speak"

Distinguishes between **Language Comprehension** and **Language Production**.<br>The Sender-Receiver Model can also be explained via the LUF.<br>The LUF needs a certain number of components for this:

- **Representation & Rules** (LTM)
- **Processing Components** (e.g. sentence parser)
- **Working Memory** (STM)
- **Cognitive & Attentional Control, and Monitoring**

**Linguistics** is concerned with **structure**, **psycholinguistics** with **processes**



**Information Stream Types:**

- **Autonomic:** one-way
- **Interaction:** two-way



**Language Process Types:**

- **Automatic:** involuntary, unconscious, doesn't affect the attentional system or its resources
- **Controlled:** voluntary, conscious, affects the attentional system and its resources, *SERIAL* (doesn't occur simultaneously with another process)
