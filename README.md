I use the markdown editor [Typora](https://typora.io/) to write these summaries. So the formatting in Github and the HTML files might be off. 

If you want to read the summaries in the same format that I write them, download [Typora](https://typora.io/) and use the [Academic](https://theme.typora.io/theme/Academic/)Â theme.
